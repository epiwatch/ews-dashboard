# Contributing to EPIWATCH

We welcome contributions!

## How to Contribute

We will be actively working to support and develop a contributor community very soon. In the meantime, if you have a suggestion that would make EPIWATCH better, please [contact us!](https://www.epiwatch.org/contact)

## Contributor Agreement

To protect the EPIWATCH community and ensure project sustainability, all external contributions to this project require a signed contributor assignment agreement.

To simplify this, we adopt the following agreements developed by the open source community:

- "_Harmony Individual Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA), Version 1.0_", with outbound license "_Option 5_", in Sections 2.1(f)
- "_Harmony Entity Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA), Version 1.0_", with outbound license "_Option 5_", in Sections 2.1(f).

Please see [ha-combined-v1.pdf](ha-combined-v1.pdf) for text of the agreement.
